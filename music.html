        The violin, sometimes referred as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone, and is the smallest, and thus
        highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in regular use in the violin family. Smaller violin-type instruments exist,
        including the violino piccolo and the pochette, but these are virtually unused. Most violins have a hollow
        wooden body, and commonly have four strings (sometimes five), <samp class="clr">usually tuned in perfect fifths
            with notes G3, D4,
            A4, E5, and are most commonly played by drawing a bow across the strings. The violin can also be played by
            plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases,</samp> by striking the strings
        with the
        wooden side of the bow (col legno).

        <br><br><br>

        Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western
        classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments. Violins are
        also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz. Electric
        violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric <samp class="clr"> pickups are used in some forms of rock music and
            jazz fusion, with
            the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound. The violin has come to be
            incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The name fiddle
            is
            often used regardless of the type of music played on it.</samp>
        <br><br><br>

        The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th
        centuries to give the instrument <samp class="clr">a more powerful sound and projection. In Europe, it served as
            the basis for the
            development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music,</samp> such as the viola.
        <br><br><br>

        Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari, Guarneri,
        Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) and by Jacob
        Stainer in Austria. According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or
        equal it, though this belief is disputed.<samp class="clr">Great <strong class="clr"> of instruments have come
                from the hands
                of less

                cottage</strong>

        formerly sold
        by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers.

    <h1 class="top">Violin Etymology</h1>
    <p>
        The word "violin" was first used in English in the 1570s. The word "violin" comes from "Italian violino,
        diminutive of viola. The term "viola" comes from the expression for "tenor violin" in 1797, from Italian and Old
        Provençal viola, [which came from] Medieval Latin vitula as a term which means 'stringed instrument', perhaps
        [coming] from Vitula, Roman goddess of joy...,<samp class="clr"> or from related Latin verb vitulari, "to cry
            out in joy or
            exaltation." The related term Viola da gamba meaning 'bass viol' (1724) is from Italian, literally "a viola
            for the leg" (i.e. to hold between the legs)."</samp> A violin is the "modern form of the smaller, medieval
        viola da
        braccio." ("arm viola")
        <br><br><br>
        The violin is often called a fiddle.<samp class="clr"> "Fiddle" can be used as the instrument's</samp> customary
        name in folk music, or
        as an informal name for the instrument in other styles of music. The word "fiddle" was first used in English
        in the late 14th century. The word "fiddle" comes from "fedele, fydyll, fidel, earlier fithele, from Old
        English fiðele 'fiddle', which is related to Old Norse fiðla, <samp class="clr">Middle Dutch vedele, Dutch
            vedel, Old High German
            fidula, German Fiedel, 'a fiddle'; all of uncertain origin."</samp> As to the origin of the word "fiddle",
        the
        "...usual suggestion, based on resemblance in sound and sense, is that it is from Medieval Latin vitula."

        The earliest stringed instruments were mostly plucked (for example, the Greek lyre). Two-stringed, bowed
        instruments, played upright and strung and bowed with horsehair, may have originated in the nomadic equestrian
        cultures of Central Asia, in forms closely resembling the<samp class="clr"> modern-day Mongolian Morin huur and
            the Kazakh Kobyz.
            Similar and variant types were probably disseminated along eastwest </samp>trading routes from Asia into the
        Middle
        East, and the Byzantine Empire.
        <br><br><br>
        Rebec, fiddle and lira da braccio are generally considered the ancestors of the violin , Several sources
        suggest alternative possibilities <samp class="clr">for the violin's origins, such as northern or western
            Europe. The
            first makers of violins probably borrowed from various developments of the Byzantine lyra. These included
            the
            vielle (also known as the fidel or viuola) and the lira da braccio. The violin in its present form
            emerged in early 16th-century northern Italy. The earliest pictures of violins,</samp> albeit with three
        strings, are
        seen in northern Italy around 1530, at around the same time as the words "violino" and "vyollon" are seen in
        Italian and French documents. One of the earliest explicit descriptions of the instrument, including its tuning,
        is from the Epitome musical by Jambe de Fer, published in Lyon in 1556. By this time, the violin had already
        begun to spread throughout Europe.
        <br><br><br>
        The violin proved very popular, both among street musicians and the nobility; the French king Charles IX ordered
        Andrea Amati to construct<samp class="clr"> 24 violins for him in 1560. One of these "noble" instruments, the
            Charles IX, is
            the oldest surviving violin. The finest Renaissance carved and decorated violin in the world</samp> is the
        Gasparo da
        Salò (c.1574) owned by Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria and later, from 1841, by the Norwegian virtuoso Ole
        Bull, who used it for forty years and thousands of concerts, for its very powerful and beautiful tone, similar
        to that of a Guarneri. "The Messiah" or "Le Messie" (also known as the "Salabue") made by Antonio Stradivari
        in 1716 remains pristine. It is now located in the Ashmolean Museum of Oxford.

        <samp class="clr">A violin generally consists of a spruce top (the soundboard, also known as the top plate,
            table, or belly),
            maple ribs and back, two endblocks</samp>, a neck, a bridge, a soundpost, four strings, and various
        fittings,
        optionally including a chinrest, which may attach directly over, or to the left of, the tailpiece. A distinctive
        feature of a violin body is its hourglass-like shape and the arching of its top and back. The hourglass shape
        comprises two upper bouts, two lower bouts, and two concave C-bouts at the waist, providing clearance for the
        <img style="float: right;" src="mechanic.png" alt="">
        bow. The "voice" or sound of a violin depends on its shape, the wood it is made from, the graduation (the
        thickness profile) <samp class="clr">of both the top and back, the varnish that coats its outside surface and
            the skill of the
            luthier in doing all of these steps. </samp>The varnish and especially the wood continue to improve with
        age, making
        the fixed supply of old well-made violins built by famous luthiers much sought-after.
        <br><br><br>
        The majority of glued joints in the instrument use animal hide glue rather than common white glue for a number
        of reasons. Hide glue is capable of making a thinner joint than most other glues. It is reversible (brittle
        enough to crack <samp class="clr">with carefully applied force and removable with hot water) when disassembly is
            needed. Since
            fresh hide glue sticks to old hide glue, more original wood can be preserved when repairing a joint. (More
            modern glues must be cleaned off entirely for the new joint to be sound, which generally involves scraping
            off
            some wood along with the old glue.) Weaker, </samp>diluted glue is usually used to fasten the top to the
        ribs, and the
        nut to the fingerboard, since common repairs involve removing these parts. The purfling running around the edge
        of the spruce top provides some protection against cracks originating at the edge. It also allows the top to
        flex more independently of the rib structure. <samp class="clr">Painted-on faux purfling on the top is usually a
            sign of an
            inferior instrument. The back and ribs are typically made of maple, most often with a matching striped
            figure,
            referred to as flame,</samp> fiddleback, or tiger stripe.
        <br><br><br>
        The neck is usually maple with a flamed figure compatible with that of the ribs and back. It carries the
        fingerboard, typically made of ebony, <samp class="clr">but often some other wood stained or painted black on
            cheaper instruments.</samp>
        Ebony is the preferred material because of its hardness, beauty, and superior resistance to wear. Fingerboards
        are dressed to a particular transverse curve, and have a small lengthwise "scoop," or concavity, slightly more
        pronounced on the lower strings, especially <samp class="clr">when meant for gut or synthetic strings. Some old
            violins (and some
            made to appear old) have a grafted scroll,</samp> evidenced by a glue joint between the pegbox and neck.
        Many authentic
        old instruments have had their necks reset to a slightly increased angle, and lengthened by about a centimeter.
        The neck graft allows the original scroll to be kept with a Baroque violin when bringing its neck into
        conformance with modern standards.

        Strings were first made of sheep gut (commonly known as catgut, which despite the name, did not come from cats),
        or simply gut, which was stretched, dried, and twisted. In the early years of the 20th century, strings were
        made of either gut or steel.<samp class="clr"> Modern strings may be gut, solid steel, stranded steel, or
            various synthetic
            materials such as perlon, wound with various metals, and sometimes plated with silver. Most E strings are
            unwound, either plain or plated steel. Gut strings</samp> are not as common as they once were, but many
        performers use
        them to achieve a specific sound especially in historically informed performance of Baroque music. Strings have
        a limited lifetime. Eventually, when oil, dirt, corrosion, and rosin accumulate, the mass of the string can
        become uneven along its length. Apart from obvious things, <samp class="clr">such as the winding of a string
            coming undone from
            wear, players generally change a string when it no longer plays "true" </samp>(with good intonation on the
        harmonics),
        losing the desired tone, brilliance and intonation. String longevity depends on string quality and playing
        intensity.

        players whose
        fingers are not long enough to reach the correct positions on full-sized instruments.

        While related in some sense to the dimensions of the instruments, the fractional sizes are not intended to be
        literal descriptions of relative proportions. For example,<samp class="clr"> a 3⁄4-sized instrument</samp> is
        not three-quarters the
        length of a full size instrument. The body length (not including the neck) of a full-size, <samp class="clr">or

        mm (14.0 in), smaller in some 17th-century models. <samp class="clr">A 3⁄4 violin's </samp>body length is 335 mm
        (13.2 in), and<samp class="clr"> a 1⁄2
            size is 310 mm (12.2 in)</samp>. With the violin's closest family member, the viola, size is specified as
        body length
        in inches or centimeters rather than fractional sizes. A full-size viola averages 40 cm (16 in). However, each
        individual adult will determine which size of viola to use.

        Occasionally, an adult with a small frame may use a <samp class="clr">so-called 7⁄8 size violin</samp> instead

        Sometimes called a lady's violin,<samp class="clr"> these instruments are slightly shorter than a full size
