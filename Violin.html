        The violin, sometimes referred as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone, and is the smallest, and thus
        highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in regular use in the violin family. Smaller violin-type instruments exist,
        including the violino piccolo and the pochette, but these are virtually unused. Most violins have a hollow
        wooden body, and commonly have four strings (sometimes five), <samp class="clr">usually tuned in perfect fifths
            with notes G3, D4,
            A4, E5, and are most commonly played by drawing a bow across the strings. The violin can also be played by
            plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases,</samp> by striking the strings
        with the
        wooden side of the bow (col legno).

        <br><br><br>

        Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western
        classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments. Violins are
        also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz. Electric
        violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric <samp class="clr"> pickups are used in some forms of rock music and
            jazz fusion, with
            the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound. The violin has come to be
            incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music. The name fiddle
            is
            often used regardless of the type of music played on it.</samp>

        The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th
        centuries to give the instrument <samp class="clr">a more powerful sound and projection. In Europe, it served as
            the basis for the
            development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music,</samp> such as the viola.
        <br><br><br>

        Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari, Guarneri,
        Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) and by Jacob
        Stainer in Austria. According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or
        equal it, though this belief is disputed.<samp class="clr">Great <strong class="clr"> of instruments have come
                from the hands
                of less
                famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced commercial "trade violins" coming from
                cottage</strong>
            industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt. </samp>Many of these trade instruments were
        formerly sold
        by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers.

        The components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood. Violins can be strung with gut, Perlon
        or other synthetic, or steel strings.<samp class="clr"> A person who makes or repairs violins is called a
            luthier or violinmaker.
            One who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or bowmaker.</samp>
