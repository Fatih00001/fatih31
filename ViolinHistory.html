        The earliest stringed instruments were mostly plucked (for example, the Greek lyre). Two-stringed, bowed
        instruments, played upright and strung and bowed with horsehair, may have originated in the nomadic equestrian
        cultures of Central Asia, in forms closely resembling the<samp class="clr"> modern-day Mongolian Morin huur and
            the Kazakh Kobyz.
            Similar and variant types were probably disseminated along eastwest </samp>trading routes from Asia into the
        Middle
        East, and the Byzantine Empire.

        Rebec, fiddle and lira da braccio are generally considered the ancestors of the violin , Several sources
        suggest alternative possibilities <samp class="clr">for the violin's origins, such as northern or western
            Europe. The
            first makers of violins probably borrowed from various developments of the Byzantine lyra. These included
            the
            vielle (also known as the fidel or viuola) and the lira da braccio. The violin in its present form
            emerged in early 16th-century northern Italy. The earliest pictures of violins,</samp> albeit with three
        strings, are
        seen in northern Italy around 1530, at around the same time as the words "violino" and "vyollon" are seen in
        Italian and French documents. One of the earliest explicit descriptions of the instrument, including its tuning,
        is from the Epitome musical by Jambe de Fer, published in Lyon in 1556. By this time, the violin had already
        begun to spread throughout Europe.

        The violin proved very popular, both among street musicians and the nobility; the French king Charles IX ordered
        Andrea Amati to construct<samp class="clr"> 24 violins for him in 1560. One of these "noble" instruments, the
            Charles IX, is
            the oldest surviving violin. The finest Renaissance carved and decorated violin in the world</samp> is the
        Gasparo da
        Sal√≤ (c.1574) owned by Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria and later, from 1841, by the Norwegian virtuoso Ole
        Bull, who used it for forty years and thousands of concerts, for its very powerful and beautiful tone, similar
        to that of a Guarneri. "The Messiah" or "Le Messie" (also known as the "Salabue") made by Antonio Stradivari
        in 1716 remains pristine. It is now located in the Ashmolean Museum of Oxford.
